                  <p><b>Study title:</b> Concepts and Body Image</p>
                  <p><b>Lead researcher:</b> Sean Devine </p>
                  <p><b>Researchers’ Contact Information:</b> Dept. of Psychology, Concordia University 7141 Sherbrooke St. Ouest, Montréal, H4B 1R6 (514-848-2424 x2397; seandamiandevine@gmail.com).</p>
                  <p><b>Faculty Supervisor:</b> Dr. Ben Eppinger  (ben.eppinger@concordia.ca)</p>

                   <h3><b>STUDY PURPOSE</b></h3>
                   <p>
                    The purpose of this study is to investigate how people make judgements about bodies.
                   </p>
                  <h3><b>PROCEDURE</b></h3>
                  <p>
                   If you participate, you will be asked to complete a series of short questionnaires and an online task.
                   The questionnaires will ask you questions about your eating habits, background, and mental health.
                   The online task will involve seeing a series of pictures of bodies and faces and making a judgement about them.
                   The whole study should take no more than an hour.
                 </p>
                 <h3><b>RISKS AND BENEFITS</b></h3>
                 <p>
                  There are no direct advantages for participation in this study, and this research is not intended to benefit you personally.
                  <br><br>
                  The principal disadvantage of participating in this study is the time it will take you to participate in the testing session.
                  There is a slight risk that you might feel a small sense of guilt from some of the judgments you are making.
                  Importantly, these feelings are normal when completing tasks of this sort and should not be taken to any malicious intent on your part.
                  If you wish to discuss any concerns, you may contact Dr. Ben Eppinger PhD, the research project leader (514-848-2424 ext. 2397).
                 </p>
                 <h3><b>CONFIDENTIALITY</b></h3>
                 <p>
                   We will gather the following information as part of this research:
                   <ul>
                     <li>Demographic information (including information on your weight, age, height, and any physical or cognitive problems you may have).</li>
                     <li>Judgment about a series of computer-generated bodies and faces you will see.</li>
                   </ul>
                   We will not allow anyone to access the information, except people directly involved in conducting the research.
                    We will only use the information for the purposes of the research described in this form.
                    The information gathered will be coded. That means that the information will be identified by a code.
                    The researcher will have a list that links the code to your name.
                    We will protect the information by storing it in a locked and secure location at Concordia University, and in the case of digital information, in a password protected file on a secure server.
                     We intend to publish the results of the research. However, it will not be possible to identify you in the published results.
                     We will destroy the information five years after the end of the study.
                 </p>
                   <h3><b>CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION</b></h3>
                   <p>
                     You do <b>not</b> have to participate in this research. It is entirely your decision.
                     If you do participate, you can stop at any time.
                     You can also ask that the information you provided not be used, and your choice will be respected.
                     If you decide that you don’t want us to use your information, please contact us within 3 weeks of your participation and we will exclude your data from any future analyses or publications.
                     Participants who complete the study will receive a compensation of £5.00/hour.
                     To make sure that research money is being spent properly, auditors from Concordia or outside will have access to a coded list of participants. It will not be possible to identify you from this list.
                     There are no negative consequences for not participating, stopping in the middle, or asking us not to use your information.
                 </p>
