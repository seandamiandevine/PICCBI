                   <h3><b>What the study was about</b></h3>
                   <p>
                     In this study we are trying to understand how people’s judgments about bodies are affected by a phenomenon called prevalence-induced concept change.
                    <br><br>
                     When the prevalence of an object – the frequency that that object shows up in the environment – decreases, people expand their concept of it.
                     We believed the same principle applies to judgments about others’ and our own bodies.
                     That is, when the prevalence of overweight bodies in the media decrease, our concept of “overweight” expands to include bodies that we otherwise would have said are thin; including our own body.
                     This is one of the ways we believe the “thin ideal” of beauty gets internalized in the West.
                     <br><br>
                     To address whether this is the case, we acquired participants’ judgments about bodies and their response times.
                     This was all collected to help better understand how prevalence-induced concept change affects judgments of others’ and our own bodies.
                     <br><br>
                     These data will contribute to our understanding of how prevalence-induced concept change affects body image as well as the  social and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the phenomenon.
                     This knowledge will be valuable in better understanding how people come to view others’ and their own bodies.
                     <br><br>
                     We also acquired participants' judgements about the geographic origin of certain faces. This was done to validate a separate study on prevalence-induced concept change and ethnicity.
